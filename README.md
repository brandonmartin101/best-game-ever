# Best Game EVER

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at [Best Game Ever](https://brandonmartin101.github.io/best-game-ever/).


## Project Description

A spaceship dodging asteroids. Because space is cool.


## Game Logic

```
  - The player can move the ship up or down
  - Asteroids will spawn randomly and move from right to left
  - If an asteroid touches the player, he is destroyed and must start over
  - A score generates based on how far the spaceship gets through the asteroid field
  - High score is saved through multiple playthroughs
```

### MVP Criteria

- Game must be playable
- Multiple rounds can be played

### Post-MVP Plans

- Space music should play
- Asteroids make a sound when passing by
- Spaceship makes an exploding sound when it crashes
- High score is saved in localstorage for subsequent playthroughs
